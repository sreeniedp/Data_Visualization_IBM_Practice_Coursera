# Data_Visualization_IBM_Practice_Coursera
### Contains some of the useful data visualization techniques taught in [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-for-data-visualization) using Canada immigration data. 
Canda.xlsx contains name of countries, continents, and number of immigrants from the year 1980 to 2013.<br> 
Apart from bar plot, pie charts and usual bubble plots, Folium library was used to create world map. <br> 
Eventually [Choropleth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) maps are produced to represent the number density <br> of immigrnats from all over the world in the year 1985 and 2005. <br>
The jupyter notebook is pretty self-explanatory and more info can be found related to this in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/interpreting-data-through-visualization-with-python-matplotlib-ef795b411900). <br>

Here is an example of cool pie plot ![pie plot](https://github.com/suvoooo/Data_Visualization_IBM_Practice_Coursera/blob/master/Pie_Imm_to_Canda_Cont_1985_2005.png)
